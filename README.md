### Generic registry migrator
The generic registry migrator works against token based registries. This includes DockerHub, Artifactory registries, and many others. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query the source registry (using standard Docker registry apis) to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py generic [-h]
                                        [--source-username SOURCE_USERNAME]
                                        [--source-password SOURCE_PASSWORD]

                                        [--image-file IMAGE_FILE]
                                        [--source-project HARBOR_SOURCE_PROJECT]
                                        [--target-subfolder RT_TARGET_SUBFOLDER]
                                        source artifactory username password
                                        repo

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ignore-certs        Ignore any certificate errors from both source and
                        destination
  --overwrite           Overwrite existing image/tag on the destination
  --num-of-workers WORKERS
                        Number of worker threads. Defaults to 2.
  -v, --verbose         Make the operation more talkative
  --image-file IMAGE_FILE
                        Limit the import to a set of images in the provided
                        file. Format of new line separated file: '<image-
                        name>:<tag>' OR '<image-name>' to import all tags of
                        that repository.
  --source-project HARBOR_SOURCE_PROJECT_TO_BE_TRIMMED_OR_REPLACED
                        Checks each images in --image-file; trims the image prefix that has the same 
                        name with --source-project. Only works together with --image-file
  --target-subfolder RT_TARGET_SUBFOLDER
                        Add a subfolder as a prefix to the images in --image-file. 
                        Only works together with --image-file and --source-project

source:
  source                The source registry URL
  --source-username SOURCE_USERNAME
                        The username to use for authentication to the source
  --source-password SOURCE_PASSWORD
                        The password to use for authentication to the source

artifactory:
  artifactory           The destination Artifactory URL
  username              The username to use for authentication to Artifactory
  password              The password to use for authentication to Artifactory
  repo                  The docker repository in Artifactory to store the images
```

#### Importing from DockerHub
DockerHub does not implement the catalog API. To migrate images from DockerHub, follow these guide lines:

1. Set the source registry URL as https://registry-1.docker.io
2. Provide an [image file list](#image-file-format) of the images you want to migrate
3. If the image is an 'offiial' image (like centos, busybox, hello-world), the name must be prepended with `library/`. For centos, this would look be `library/centos` or `library/centos:latest` for the latest tag.
4. If you are migrating images that are private, provide the --source-username and --source-password.

### DTR registry migrator
The DTR registry migrator works against the Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). The generic migrator can also be used for DTR but will rely on standard APIs (which have known issues in DTR). This version will use DTR proprietary APIs (api/v0) for the auto-discovery mechanism. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query DTR APIs to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py dtr [-h] [--ignore-certs] [--overwrite]
                                    [--num-of-workers WORKERS] [-v]
                                    [--image-file IMAGE_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ignore-certs        Ignore any certificate errors from both source and
                        destination
  --overwrite           Overwrite existing image/tag on the destination
  --num-of-workers WORKERS
                        Number of worker threads. Defaults to 2.
  -v, --verbose         Make the operation more talkative

                        Limit the import to a set of images in the provided
                        file. Format of new line separated file: '<image-
                        name>:<tag>' OR '<image-name>' to import all tags of
                        that repository.

                        images
```

### Quay registry migrator
The Quay registry migrator works against Quay's SaaS offering. It works against both public and private registries. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query the source registry (using Quay specifc apis) to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

To use this tool, you **need** to [generate a token for internal application use](https://docs.quay.io/api/).

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py quay [-h] [--ignore-certs] [--overwrite]
                                     [--num-of-workers WORKERS] [-v]

### Quay Enterprise Edition registry migrator
The Quay registry migrator works against Quay's Enterprise offering. It works against both public and private registries. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query the source registry to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

To use this tool, you need to provide the *super user's* credentials or an oauth [token](https://docs.quay.io/api/) with all permissions.

#### LIMITATIONS

Quay does not have the concept of an all seeing user. The super user cannot see other users' repositories. **To properly import all repositories, all users/organizations should grant the super user being used READ access to their repositories.**

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py quayee [-h]
                                       [--source-username SOURCE_USERNAME]

```

### Amazon ECR registry migrator
The Amazon ECR registry migrator works against Amazon's ECR service. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query the source registry (using standard Docker registry apis) to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

#### Getting the token

Amazon does not support token authentication like Docker token based registries expect them. Instead, you need to generate an Amazon token/password (which will be valid for 12 hours) to use with this tool.
To do so, you can perform the following call with the aws tool (see [Registry Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth)):


```bash
aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
```

This will produce an output like this:

```bash
docker login -u AWS -p password https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

The token you need to supply to this tool is the *password* from above, the source will be the URL provided above (in this example the token would be password and the source https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com).

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py ecr [-h] [--ignore-certs] [--overwrite]
                                    [--num-of-workers WORKERS] [-v]
                                    [--image-file IMAGE_FILE]
                                    source token artifactory username password
                                    repo

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ignore-certs        Ignore any certificate errors from both source and
                        destination
  --overwrite           Overwrite existing image/tag on the destination
  --num-of-workers WORKERS
                        Number of worker threads. Defaults to 2.
  -v, --verbose         Make the operation more talkative
  --image-file IMAGE_FILE
                        Limit the import to a set of images in the provided
                        file. Format of new line separated file: '<image-
                        name>:<tag>' OR '<image-name>' to import all tags of
                        that repository.

source:
  source                The source registry URL
  token                 The token generated by the aws tool

  artifactory           The destination Artifactory URL
  username              The username to use for authentication to Artifactory
  password              The password to use for authentication to Artifactory
  repo                  The docker repository in Artifactory to store the images
```


### Google Container Registry migrator
The GCR migrator works against Google's GCR service. The this tool has two modes of operation, auto-discovery and guided migrations. In auto-discovery mode, the tool will query the source registry (using standard Docker registry apis) to get a full listing of all the available image names and tags. It will then migrate all of the images it finds. In the guided mode, you provide a list of image names and tags you wish to migrate (see [Image file format](#image-file-format))

#### Getting the JSON key file

You will need a [JSON key file](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#serviceaccounts) with the correct permissions to perform the migration. If you do not already have one, follow [Google's Advanced Authentication document](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#using_a_json_key_file).

#### Input

```bash
usage: python DockerMigrator.py gcr [-h] [--source SOURCE] [--ignore-certs]
                                    [--overwrite] [--num-of-workers WORKERS]
                                    [-v] [--image-file IMAGE_FILE]
                                    keyfile artifactory username password repo

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ignore-certs        Ignore any certificate errors from both source and
                        destination
  --overwrite           Overwrite existing image/tag on the destination
  --num-of-workers WORKERS
                        Number of worker threads. Defaults to 2.
  -v, --verbose         Make the operation more talkative
  --image-file IMAGE_FILE
                        Limit the import to a set of images in the provided
                        file. Format of new line separated file: '<image-
                        name>:<tag>' OR '<image-name>' to import all tags of
                        that repository.

source:
  --source SOURCE       The source registry URL (defaults to https://gcr.io)
  keyfile               The Google JSON key file

artifactory:
  artifactory           The destination Artifactory URL
  username              The username to use for authentication to Artifactory
  password              The password to use for authentication to Artifactory
  repo                  The docker repository in Artifactory to store the images
```

### Image file format
The image file format accepts two types of entries. The first is specifying an image and optionally a namespace. The second is specifying an image (and optional a namespace) and a tag. When the first option is used (no tag is specified), the tool will migrate ALL the tags for that particular image name.

For example:
```
busybox
jfrog/artifactory-pro
jfrog/mission-control:1.0
```

This would result in all tags of `busybox` and `jfrog/artifactory-pro` being migrated but only the 1.0 tag for `jfrog/mission-control`.

## Security Migration

To migrate security information from the Docker registry to Artifactory, follow the steps described at the Data Migration session but use the `SecurityMigrator.py` script instead of `DockerMigrator.py`. Examples:

* Using Python: 
```bash
python SecurityMigrator.py ......
```
   * Using Docker: 
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:2.7.14 python SecurityMigrator.py .....
```

### Docker EE Security Migration

Using this option, the tool reads Users, Organizations and Teams data from Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Permissions information from Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) and creates the appropriate Users, Groups and Permissions in Artifactory. This feature has been tested with UCP 2.2.5 and DTR 2.4.1.

#### Input
